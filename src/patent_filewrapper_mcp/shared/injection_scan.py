"""Injection-shaped-content detector for retrieved file-wrapper text.

Detection, NEVER stripping: verbatim fidelity of prosecution-document text is
the product, so this module only ANNOTATES — when returned OCR output,
office-action text, or application XML contains instruction-override,
prompt-extraction, or encoding-evasion language, or a suspicious density of
invisible Unicode (the steganography carrier), the tool attaches an
`injection_scan` warning naming the hit so the consuming model and the user
see that the quoted content is injection-shaped. The text itself is returned
untouched. Complements the RETRIEVED_TEXT_NOTE labeling posture (below) and
docs/CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md.

Pattern taxonomy adapted from this repo's own pre-commit detector
(.security/patent_prompt_injection_detector.py), narrowed to the
high-confidence generic groups — patterns that essentially never occur in
genuine prosecution prose, so a match is signal, not noise. The two layers
are complementary, not substitutes: the pre-commit scanner guards the repo's
own source tree at commit time; this module annotates retrieved USPTO corpus
content at tool-call time. It must stay stdlib-only (never import from
.security/, which depends on detect_secrets). Content-minimization: callers
must never log the matched text, only the kind labels.
