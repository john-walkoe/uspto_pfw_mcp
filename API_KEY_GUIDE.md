**⚠️ Important Information Governance Note:**

The USPTO PFW MCP server (and all of the author's USPTO MCP servers) only use Mistral OCR to have the LLM read **publicly available USPTO documents**. This usage should not raise information governance concerns.

However, if you use the API key separately outside the scope of the USPTO PFW MCP to:
- Scan and OCR client documents
- Use other Mistral API endpoints (e.g., chat API)

Then the **free tier may not be appropriate** due to the terms of service stating: **"API requests may be used to improve our services"**

---

### Step 4: Verify Phone Number

10. Verify your phone number
